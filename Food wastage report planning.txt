inventory report in how much was wasted and how much was delivered donated out.
Include formulas to calculate total requests, which category of food is in higher demand of request.

1. Date/Time-Based Data

    Date Created: When the food item was added to the inventory.
    Last Modified Date: Tracks changes to the inventory, such as updates to quantity or expiry date.
    Expiry Date: A critical field to track potential wastage (items approaching or past expiration).
    Request Date: Date when a request was made by NGOs.
    Approval/Rejection Date: Track when requests were approved or rejected.
    Receive Time: Time when the NGO expects or schedules to receive the food.

2. Food Category-Based Data

    Category: Different categories like "Fruits and Vegetables," "Dairy Products," "Meat and Fish," etc., can help identify which types of food are wasted more frequently.
    Quantity: The amount of food available and requested, which directly impacts food wastage.

3. User-Specific Data

    Donor (Restaurant): Identify which restaurant donated the food (potentially track wastage per donor).
    NGO: Which NGO requested the food, and whether they collected it or rejected it.

4. Request/Delivery Status Data

    Requested Quantity vs Available Quantity: Helps analyze how much was requested vs how much was actually available.
    Request Status: Whether the request was 'Pending,' 'Approved,' or 'Rejected.'
    Delivery Completed: Tracks if the delivery of the requested food has been completed or not, which can indicate if any food remained undelivered and potentially wasted.
    Rejection Remark: Explains why the request was rejected (e.g., poor food quality, excess availability, etc.), helping to track wastage reasons.
    Receive Method: Indicates whether the food was collected by the NGO or delivered by the restaurant.
